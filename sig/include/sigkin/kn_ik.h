//======================================= KnIk =====================================

/*! Provides the analytical IK solver for arms and legs, given the desired orbit angle.
	In addition, a solver with automatic orbit angle search is included.
	The final twist can be either applied before or after the end joint swing, according
	to the given parameters during initialization (see methods init()).
	Swing-twist axis convention, considering the character in a standing position, with
	arms completely outstreched to the sides:
	Arms: when looking from each hand to the shoulder, with the character's head up:
		  shoulder's X axis points to the right, and Y axis to the top. The thumb is up.
	Legs: when looking from the feet to the head, with feet toes pointing up:
		  hip's X axis points to the bottom, and Y axis to the right. 
	Note: when the swing-twist end joint has the "mid twist", ie the twist comes after
	the swing, the ellipse defining the swing limits is not twisted with the end joint,
	and this is a problem as the limits will become inversed.
	A simple "solution" is to use equal limits in X and Y, ie, use a circle to define
	swing limits. The same problem occurs with the twisting.
	As this configuration is not in use, a better solution for that is still missing.
	Note 2: **Arms and Legs offsets MUST be along one single axis*** */
