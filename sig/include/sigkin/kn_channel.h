/*! KnChannel specifies a channel type, a joint name, and its connection
	status. A channel can be seen as an extension of a DOF
	to more complex parameterizations of a group of DOFs. 
	For example, a channel can be a (Euler) rotation around one axis,
	a swing rotation, a full quaternion, etc. Possible channels
	are enumerated in the enum Type.
	Note that KnChannel only specifies a channel and does not maintain
	any joint values. */
