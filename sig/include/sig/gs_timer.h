	\brief Measure time and execution per second rates.

	GsTimer is intended to help counting the time taken by any function or
	portion of code. It can also be used to measure the frames per second 
	rate of an application. After instantiation, the user should call start()
	just before the function to measure the time, and stop() right after. Then,
	the method dt() will return the elapsed time between both function calls.
	Many other time measurements are possible. It is considered that each time
	the start/end pair is called, one measurement is done. In this way the user
	can perform several measurements (like in a loop) and then retrieve the 
	meandt(), calculated according to the specified interval(). Times between
	measurements can also be retrieved with loopdt(). */
