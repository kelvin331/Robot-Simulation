/*! \class SnNode sn_node.h
	\brief base of all scene node classes

	Defines a base class for all scene nodes.
	1. It cannot be directly instantiated by the user, and so there is no 
	   public constructor available.
	2. Scene nodes start with Sn (scene actions start with Sa, see sa_action.h).
	3. A reference counter is used for automatically deleting unused nodes,
	   see ref() and unref() methods in the parent class GsShareable. 
	4. Each node is of a given type among 5 possible ones:
	1. a group manages a list of children nodes;
	2. a transform defines a transformation to affect children nodes;
	3. a shape defines a geometric shape to be rendered;
	4. an editor node handles events, a transformation, and children nodes;
	5. a material node gives material info to the next shape for geometry sharing. */
